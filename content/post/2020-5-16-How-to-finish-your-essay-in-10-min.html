<p>I always like to help others.</p>
<p>If you realized you have a deadline in 10 minutes, don’t worry, there is a way help you not fail the assignment. It’s only the last resort, and it may only pass when following assumptions are meet:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are Year 1 or Year 2 undergraduate student</li>
<li>Your assignment is to write a review essay without any data analysis.</li>
<li>Check plagiarism and add citation</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I will show you how to use the <a href="https://www.essaybot.com">EssayBot</a>.</p>
<p>First, write your title of essay and a little bit words to describe the title, like what I did:<br />

<p>Then you will select a first paragraph. I select this one:
<img src="C:/Users/Wanqi/Desktop/github/blog/image/eb3.PNG" /></p>
<p>Then you can search and select the paragraph you need:

<p>Then you can finish a short essay, don’t remember to change sentence and add citation on red highlight part, which may be a plagiarism.

<p>I need to state that, it’s definitely a terrible essay, but it save time and less likely to fail in our undergraduate assignment.</p>
<p>I also need to state that, I never use it in any assignments or work…I am just happy to save others.</p>
