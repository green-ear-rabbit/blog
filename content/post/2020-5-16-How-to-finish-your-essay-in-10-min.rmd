I always like to help others. 

If you realized you have a deadline in 10 minutes, don't worry, there is a way help you not fail the assignment. It's only the last resort, and it may only pass when following assumptions are meet:

 - You are Year 1 or Year 2 undergraduate student
 - Your assignment is to write a review essay without any data analysis.
 - Check plagiarism and add citation
 
Now I will show you how to use the [EssayBot](https://www.essaybot.com).

First, write your title of essay and a little bit words to describe the title, like what I did:

Then you will select a first paragraph. I select this one:

Then you can search and select the paragraph you need:

Then you can finish a short essay, don't remember to change sentence and add citation on red highlight part, which may be a plagiarism.

I need to state that, it's definitely a terrible essay, but it save time and less likely to fail in our undergraduate assignment. 

I also need to state that, I never use it in any assignments or work in school...I am just happy to save others.
