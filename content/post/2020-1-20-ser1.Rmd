# Background

Diabetes prevalence is rising rapidly in China, but disease self-management among diabetes patients remains suboptimal. Research from Europe and the US indicates that religious involvement may be associated with more physical activity and healthy diet, but understanding of religious involvement among diabetes patient in China is limited. This study aimed to examine the influence of religious involvement on diabetes self-management among diabetes patients in Suzhou, China.

# Methods

Participants were recruited from an endocrinology clinic in Suzhou, China. Eligibility criteria: >18
years old, no cognitive impairment, and diagnosed with diabetes by a physician. Diabetes self
management questionnaire (DSMQ) were used as the outcome measure. Religious involvement was
measured by the Duke University Religion Index. Multiple linear regression was used to evaluate the
association between religious involvement and diabetes self management. Control variables included
age, sex, diabetes duration, alcohol use, tobacco use, educational attainment, insurance type and
living situation.

# Results

The analytic sample size was 70. The DSMQ score significantly decreased by 0.45 for every unit
increase in religious involvement (β=-0.45, p<0.05). Of the four subdomains of the DSMQ (Glucose
Management, Dietary Control, Physical Activity, and Health-Care Use), religious involvement was
significantly associated with physical activity (β=-0.27, p<-0.01), but not others. Stronger private
religious activities and intrinsic religious beliefs were associated with less physical activity (β=-1.06,
p<0.05; β=-0.31, p<0.01, respectively).

# Conclusion

Religious involvement may be associated with inadequate physical activities and thus suboptimal
diabetes self management among Chinese adults with diabetes. Further research is need to
understand the mechanisms of how religious activities may be impacting diabetes self management
in China.
