Hello! I am Green Ear Rabbit (My true name is Wanqi Wang. Because I have a rabbit and it like vegetables, I also like vegetables, vegetable is green). I am a student in China, and I am interested in epidemiology, clinical practice and statistical modeling. 

It's really interesting and exciting to learn how to make a blog in school. If there is any problems or conflicts, feel free to contact me via: greenearrabbit@163.com 

I have many years experience as a statistian, if your lab or team need a statistian, also feel free to contact me. (A statistian will make your lab much better, from study design to data analysis). 

I am also planning for my graduate school or research, if you wish coperation or willing to provide an opportunity, don't hesitate to contact me!
