<p>One good-weather afternoon when I sit in the public office and read a medical book sleepily.</p>
<p>There is a new patient just accepted by our department. It’s a patient with schizophrenia, with liver cirrhosis, and were sent to hospital by apsychia.</p>
<p>Considering schizophrenia, he was put in a separate and isolated ward.</p>
<p>I was just a student, and what I can do is only to go to ask patient’s history.</p>
<p>…

<p>I feel very sorry to hear this patient history, even if I am not supposed to be so.</p>
<p>He is not local people in this city, neither for tourism. He was from a relief station. He wanted to find a job here, but cannot find a long term job even if he can do lots of labors. He is literate and speaking is clear.</p>
<p>He did not have any abnormal behaviors even if he has schizophrenia. After several days, we found we may don’t need to allocate him to a separate room and he’s totally a normal patients.</p>
<p>He said, schizophrenia, can be aggressive or just depressive, he is the later one. As he described, he never had any aggressive behavior.</p>
<p>However, why did the psychiatrist diagnose him as schizophrenia eight years ago, rather than just depression? Will the society, the factory accept a patient with schizophrenia?</p>
<p>I think the psychiatrist should be careful to give any diagnosis. I always against the over-diagnosis in mental health. Does ADHD a real disease? Does depression a real disease? Or even, does schizophrenia a real disease? I don’t think so. For ADHD, it’s just not same as other children. For depression, bipolar and schizophrenia, it’s just a status, rather than disease.</p>
<p>Also, once a person were diagnosed as a mental disorder, it becomes a label. As this patient, even if he don’t have any aggressive behavior, he may have difficult to find a job and have a better life.</p>
