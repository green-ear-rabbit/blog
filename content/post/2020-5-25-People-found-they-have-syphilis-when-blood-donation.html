<p>At afternoon and I go to outpatient department, where I can talk and ask questions to the doctors when they are free.</p>
<p>“Many people got syphilis and are not be aware of that, but it’s not a problem. Because nowadays, people take antibiotics often, you know, even for a cold. <em>Tp.</em> is so easy to be killed. Many patients found they were infected until they go to blood donation.”</p>
<p>It’s really surprized me.</p>
