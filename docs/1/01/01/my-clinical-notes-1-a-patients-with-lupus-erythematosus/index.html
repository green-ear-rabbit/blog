<p>A 19-year-old, rural, skinny girl diagnosed with lupus erythematosus.</p>
<p>Sometimes I met and talk with her in the ward. Some of our talking are very impressive to me, both reflect environmental and socail issues.</p>
<p>After I take notes on her symptoms, I still want to ask more things, even if I am not supposed to do. I am always interested in how does people get disease. The lupus erythematosus, why does this disease come to her, rather than those bad people who are expected to get disease.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Do you parents, grandparents, or any relatives has this disease?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Nope”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Did you take any medicine before several weeks before the symtoms onset.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Nope”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Do you have any symtoms before this month? Do you have other diseases when you are young?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“No, never, I am healthy until I left my hometown and come to city. And I only cold and fever when I am young, never other diseases”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Left hometown for what?” I asked</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“To work in a manicure store, and later I got symptoms on my nose three months later.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I became interested in, and I asked, “So…how was the environment of that store? Is there any unusual smell?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Ah, Yes! There is the smell in that store, but you know, every manicure store have that smell. So the smell of manicure will cause my disease, right?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“No… no, I don’t know”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later I asked doctors in the office, will the smell of manicure cause lupus erythematosus?</p>
<p>I forgot what answer I got, but it was not a statisfied answer…</p>
