<h1>Background:</h1>
<p>Evidence suggests that Muslim minority females in the US have lower rates of
healthcare utilization than the overall population, partly due to religious-based values of privacy and
modesty, and healthcare services that lack Islamic cultural sensitivities. However, the relation
between minority Muslim identity, sex, and healthcare utilization is poorly understood in China,
despite a population of &gt;20 million Muslims. This study tested the hypothesis that healthcare
avoidance is significantly more likely among Muslim females compared to non-religiously affiliated
males and females in China.</p>
</div>
<div id="methods" class="section level1">
<h1>Methods:</h1>
<p>This study was a secondary analysis of the 2010 East Asian
Social Survey (EASS) China component. The EASS is a survey that includes nationally representative
probability samples of residents &gt; 18 years old. Health care avoidance was defined as refraining
from seeing a doctor in the past 12 months, despite an illness or injury. Multiple logistic regression
with probability sampling weights was used to examine associations between a) religious affiliation
and gender and b) health care avoidance. Control variables included age, marital status, educational
attainment, relative household income, urbanicity, province of residency, health insurance status,
chronic disease status, alcohol use, physical activity, and tobacco use. Standardized predicted
probabilities were calculated using the Margins command in Stata 15.</p>
</div>
<div id="results" class="section level1">
<h1>Results:</h1>
<p>The analytic sample size was 3461. Consistent with our hypothesis, the standardized predicted probability of refraining from seeing a doctor was significantly higher for Muslim females (64.4%, 95% CI: 45.0-83.8%)
compared with non-religiously affiliated males (40.7%, 95% CI: 37.3-44.2%) (Figure).</p>
</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level1">
<h1>Conclusion:</h1>
<p>Healthcare avoidance is very prevalent among Muslim minority females in China. Research is
needed to augment health care service uptake and elucidate how healthcare avoidance may be
impacting health outcomes among Muslim females in China.</p>
