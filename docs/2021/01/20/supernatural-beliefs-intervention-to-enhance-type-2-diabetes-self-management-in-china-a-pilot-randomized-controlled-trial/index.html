<h1>Background</h1>
<p>China has over 100 million people living with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), many of
whom experience adverse health outcomes due to suboptimal diabetes self-management.
Interventions framed around pre-existing personal beliefs in the supernatural may improve T2DM
self-management, but such interventions are lacking in China. This pilot randomized controlled trial
(RCT) examined the feasibility of a full-size RCT to evaluate the efficacy of a supernatural beliefsbased intervention on T2DM self-management in China.</p>
</div>
<div id="methods" class="section level1">
<h1>Methods</h1>
<p>In 2019, 62 T2DM patients were
enrolled at two hospitals in Suzhou, China. Participants were randomly assigned to view a 30-second
control or intervention video at baseline. The control video showed general diabetes selfmanagement information. The intervention video showed identical information, but also indicated
that some diabetics with supernatural beliefs have lower glycemic levels because their beliefs
enhanced their confidence in diabetes self-management. Development of the intervention was
guided by literature on spiritual framing health interventions. Baseline and follow-up measures after
2-12 weeks were assessed by interviewer-administered surveys in-person and by telephone,
respectively. Diabetes self-management was assessed with the Diabetes Self-Management
Questionnaire. Group differences were assessed with T-tests and Chi-square tests.</p>
</div>
<div id="results" class="section level1">
<h1>Results</h1>
<p>Comparable baseline characteristics between the control and intervention groups indicated that
randomization was successful (Table). However, follow-up retention was low, especially for the
intervention group (3% vs 31%, p&lt;0.01).</p>
</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>A full-size efficacy RCT using the current study design is unlikely to succeed. T2DM patients shown the supernatural beliefs-based intervention had significantly higher loss to follow-up that was insurmountable. Older T2DM patients in Suzhou, China may not be receptive to supernatural beliefs-based interventions delivered in clinical settings.</p>
