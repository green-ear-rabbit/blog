<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>Due in part to growing acceptance of casual sex and limited sex education, many
college students in China are increasingly vulnerable to HIV infection. Unfortunately, HIV testing
rates among college students in China remain suboptimal. Previous studies indicate that caregiver
during childhood may be associated with healthcare avoidance. This study examined the association
between childhood caregiver and HIV test uptake among college students in Suzhou, China.</p>
<p>#METHOD</p>
<p>Data were collected from a cross-sectional online survey. Links to the survey were distributed via
email to enrolled students at an English language university in East China. Eligibility criteria:
current university student between 18 and 30 years old in the study city, ever had anal, oral or
vaginal sex. Caregiver during childhood and HIV testing history was based on participantsâ€™ self
report. Logistic regression was used to assess the association between caregiver during childhood
and HIV test uptake. Age, sex, income, and household registry were entered as control variables.</p>
</div>
<div id="results" class="section level1">
<h1>RESULTS</h1>
<p>A total of 265 participants were included in the study. 8.3% of participants had ever tested for HIV,
63.4% were raised by two parents, 24.5% were raised by single parents, 7.17% were raised by one
or more grandparents, and 4.9% were raised by other people. The odds of HIV testing were3.7 times
greater for students raised by other people, compared with students raised by two parents
(OR=4.70, CI=1.110~19.916, p&lt;0.05). No significant differences in HIV testing were observed
between students raised by two parents, a single parent and grandparents.</p>
</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level1">
<h1>CONCLUSION</h1>
<p>Students who are not raised by parents or grandparents may be more likely to test for HIV, which
may due to their perceived risk, or their more responsibility to health. To improve the HIV testing
among college students, further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms of association
between childhood caregivers and HIV testing.</p>
