      <description>People in low-socioeconomic status are at a high risk of diseases and death. I saw two patients both diagnosed with intracranial tuberculoma. One of them was a middle-aged and high-income man. He lived in a VIP ward for three months. He even wanted to live in the ward for several more days, after the doctors said that he is fully recovered. The other one is a 19-year-old rural boy, he came to city alone for a higher salary work.</description>
