      <description>A 19-year-old, rural, skinny girl diagnosed with lupus erythematosus.
Sometimes I met and talk with her in the ward. Some of our talking are very impressive to me, both reflect environmental and social issues.
After I take notes on her symptoms, I still want to ask more things, even if I am not supposed to do. I am always interested in how does people get disease. The lupus erythematosus, why does this disease come to her.</description>

      <description>Tuberculosis is not only a disease in respiratory systems, it can infect many organs, for example, osseous tuberculosis, Intra-abdominal Tuberculosis and central nervous system .

The patient have kind of cognitive decline, and there is several seconds delay when he answer people’s questions, come to hospital because disability of one leg. Then he was diagnosed as intracranial tuberculosis with TB after CT and a series of serum test.</description>
