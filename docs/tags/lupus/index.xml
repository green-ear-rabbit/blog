      <description>A 19-year-old, rural, skinny girl diagnosed with lupus erythematosus.
Sometimes I met and talk with her in the ward. Some of our talking are very impressive to me, both reflect environmental and social issues.
After I take notes on her symptoms, I still want to ask more things, even if I am not supposed to do. I am always interested in how does people get disease. The lupus erythematosus, why does this disease come to her.</description>
