      <description>One good-weather afternoon when I sit in the public office and read a medical book sleepily.
There is a new patient just accepted by our department. It’s a patient with schizophrenia, with liver cirrhosis, and were sent to hospital by apsychia.
Considering schizophrenia, he was put in a separate and isolated ward.
I was just a student, and what I can do is only to go to ask patient’s history.</description>
